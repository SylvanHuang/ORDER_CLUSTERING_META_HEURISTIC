# ORDER_CLUSTERING_META_HEURISTIC
Order clustering using meta heuristic algorithm

run front.m file (gui application)
select the appropriate dataset
there are three algorithms 
1. genetic algorithm
2. particle swarm optimization 
3. Hybrid (PSO + GA)

can be selected from the popup menu

the detail implementation of the model can be reffered from 

Kuo, R. J., and L. M. Lin. "Application of a hybrid of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm for order clustering." Decision Support Systems 49.4 (2010): 451-462.
